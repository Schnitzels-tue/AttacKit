.SH NAME
attackit \- Command line tool for performing network spoofing and interception attacks

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B attackit
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fICOMMAND\fR [\fICOMMAND OPTIONS\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
AttacKit is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for performing various network attacks including ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and SSL stripping via ARP or DNS. It is designed for penetration testers and researchers to simulate and understand the risks of insecure network environments.

AttacKit offers two primary modes of operation:

.TP
.B Quiet Mode (\fB--quiet\fR)
This mode enables fine-grained, targeted attacks. It allows the attacker to specify particular victims and domains or IPs to spoof. This is ideal for stealth operations where minimizing network noise is critical. Quiet mode requires specific arguments (e.g., victim IPs, domains to spoof) depending on the attack type. It is incompatible with \fB--all-out\fR.

.TP
.B All-Out Mode (\fB--all-out\fR)
This mode is aggressive and noisy. It attempts to spoof or intercept all incoming ARP or DNS requests on the network, making it highly visible but potentially more effective in environments with broad attack surfaces. All-out mode is designed for quick, large-scale disruption or testing and cannot be used in conjunction with \fB--quiet\fR.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B --help
Prints the help menu.

.TP
.B --quiet
Runs certain attacks in silent mode, targeting specific IPs/domains. Cannot be used with \fB--all-out\fR.

.TP
.B --all-out
Runs attacks in broadcast/aggressive mode, affecting all targets. Cannot be used with \fB--quiet\fR.

.SH COMMANDS

.TP
.B --arp
\fIifaceIpOrName\fR [\fIattackerMac\fR] [\fIvictimIp\fR] [\fIipToSpoof\fR]
Performs an ARP spoofing attack. The attacker MAC is optional. Victim IP and IP to spoof are required in quiet mode. Multiple IPs can be comma-separated.

.TP
.B --dns
\fIifaceIpOrName\fR \fIattackerIp\fR [\fIvictimIps\fR] [\fIdomainsToSpoof\fR]
Performs a DNS spoofing attack. In all-out mode, targets all DNS queries. In quiet mode, \fIvictimIps\fR and \fIdomainsToSpoof\fR must be provided. Use comma-separated lists.

.TP
.B --ssldns
\fIifaceIpOrName\fR \fIattackerIp\fR \fIvictimIps\fR \fIdomainsToStrip\fR
Performs DNS-based SSL stripping. All arguments are required.

.TP
.B --sslarp
\fIifaceIpOrName\fR \fIvictimIps\fR \fIdomainsToStrip\fR
Performs ARP-based SSL stripping. All arguments are required.

.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
Perform all-out ARP spoof:
.B attackit --arp eth0 --all-out

.TP
Quiet DNS spoof:
.B attackit --quiet --dns eth0 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.15 example.com,google.com

.SH EXIT STATUS
Returns 0 on success, 1 if an exception occurs.
