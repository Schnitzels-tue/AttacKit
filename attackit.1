.SH NAME
attackit \- Network spoofing and interception toolkit for red-team operations

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B attackit
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fICOMMAND\fR [\fICOMMAND OPTIONS\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
AttacKit is a command-line tool designed for network spoofing and interception operations. It provides simulated attack capabilities such as ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and SSL stripping (via either DNS or ARP-based man-in-the-middle positioning).

The tool supports two primary operational modes:

.TP
.B Quiet Mode (\fB--quiet\fR)
Executes stealth attacks targeting specific IP addresses or domains. This mode suppresses noisy traffic and requires explicit specification of targets. Quiet mode is not compatible with \fB--all-out\fR.

.TP
.B All-Out Mode (\fB--all-out\fR)
Performs broadcast attacks on all devices or DNS queries on the network. Parameters specific to quiet mode are ignored in this mode. Cannot be combined with \fB--quiet\fR.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B --help
Displays this help screen.

.TP
.B --quiet
Enables quiet mode. Requires certain arguments per command (e.g., victim IPs and domains). Cannot be combined with --all-out.

.TP
.B --all-out
Enables broadcast attack mode. Command-specific targeting arguments (victim IPs/domains) must not be provided.

.SH COMMANDS

.TP
.B --arp
\fIifaceIpOrName\fR [\fIattackerMac\fR] [\fIvictimIp\fR] [\fIipToSpoof\fR]

Performs an ARP spoofing attack on the specified interface. The attacker's MAC address is optional and auto-detected if not provided. In \fB--quiet\fR mode, both \fIvictimIp\fR and \fIipToSpoof\fR are required. Supports comma-separated values for multiple victims and spoof targets.

In \fB--all-out\fR mode (default), targets all devices without requiring additional arguments.

Example:
.RS
\fBattackit --quiet --arp eth0 00:11:22:33:44:55 192.168.0.10,192.168.0.11 192.168.0.1\fR
.RE

.TP
.B --dns
\fIifaceIpOrName\fR \fIattackerIp\fR [\fIvictimIps\fR] [\fIdomainsToSpoof\fR]

Performs a DNS spoofing attack. In \fB--quiet\fR mode, both \fIvictimIps\fR and \fIdomainsToSpoof\fR are required. Each can be a comma-separated list. The tool will inject spoofed responses only to queries from the specified victims and only for the specified domains.

In \fB--all-out\fR mode, spoofed responses are sent to **all DNS queries** observed on the interface. In this mode, victim and domain parameters are ignored and must not be supplied.

Example:
.RS
\fBattackit --quiet --dns eth0 192.168.0.100 192.168.0.15,192.168.0.20 example.com,www.google.com\fR
.RE

.TP
.B --ssldns
\fIifaceIpOrName\fR \fIattackerIp\fR \fIvictimIps\fR \fIdomainsToStrip\fR

Performs an SSL stripping attack via DNS spoofing. The tool automatically performs DNS spoofing to redirect HTTP traffic to the attacker.

In \fB--quiet\fR mode, both \fIvictimIps\fR and \fIdomainsToStrip\fR are required. Each can be comma-separated. SSL stripping is attempted only on HTTP GET requests where both the source IP matches a victim IP and the requested domain matches a target domain.

If either condition fails, the request is ignored. This command applies exclusively to unencrypted HTTP GET requests.

In \fB--all-out\fR mode, spoofed DNS responses are sent to all queries, and any redirected HTTP GET requests received are subject to SSL stripping attempts without filtering.

Example:
.RS
\fBattackit --quiet --ssldns eth0 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.50 secure.com,banking.com\fR
.RE

.TP
.B --sslarp
\fIifaceIpOrName\fR \fIvictimIps\fR \fIdomainsToStrip\fR

Performs SSL stripping via ARP spoofing. The tool automatically runs ARP spoofing to act as a man-in-the-middle on the interface. SSL stripping is only attempted on incoming HTTP GET requests.

In \fB--quiet\fR mode, both \fIvictimIps\fR and \fIdomainsToStrip\fR must be specified. A request is stripped only if it matches both a victim IP and a target domain.

In \fB--all-out\fR mode, ARP spoofing is run without target filtering, and HTTP GET requests are stripped regardless of origin, provided the attacker is in the traffic path.

Example:
.RS
\fBattackit --quiet --sslarp eth0 192.168.0.25,192.168.0.30 login.site.com,secure.shop\fR
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
Run an all-out ARP spoofing attack:
.B attackit --arp eth0 --all-out

.TP
Perform a quiet DNS spoofing attack with specific victims and domains:
.B attackit --quiet --dns eth0 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.10,192.168.1.12 example.com,bank.com

.TP
Execute SSL stripping via DNS spoofing, filtering based on victim IP and domains:
.B attackit --quiet --ssldns eth0 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.10 secure.bank.com,login.site.net

.TP
Perform ARP-based SSL stripping with precise filtering:
.B attackit --quiet --sslarp eth0 192.168.0.50,192.168.0.51 sensitive.com,account.portal

.SH NOTES
.IP \(bu
Only one mode flag (\fB--quiet\fR or \fB--all-out\fR) may be used per command.
.IP \(bu
Comma-separated arguments allow bulk victim/domain targeting.
.IP \(bu
Some attacks require elevated privileges or raw socket access.
.IP \(bu
SSL stripping operates only on unencrypted HTTP GET traffic.

.SH EXIT STATUS

.TP
.B 0
Success

.TP
.B 1
Execution failed (invalid arguments, insufficient permissions, etc.)
